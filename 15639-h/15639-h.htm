<h2>NOTES.</h2>

<h3>THE BREECHES, OR GENEVA BIBLE.</h3>

  <p>Of this, the most popular edition of the Scriptures in the reign of
  Queen Elizabeth, we meet continually with erroneous opinions of its
  rarity, and also of its value, which the following brief statement may
  tend in a degree to correct.</p>

  <p>The translation was undertaken by certain reformers who fled to Geneva
  during the reign of Queen Mary; and is attributed to W. Whittingham,
  Anthony Gilby, Miles Coverdale, Thomas Sampson, Christopher Goodman,
  Thomas Cole, John Knox, John Bodleigh, and John Pullain; but Mr.
  Anderson, in his <i>History of the English Bible</i>, says that the
  translators were Whittingham, Gilby, and Sampson: and from the facts
  stated, he is, no doubt, correct.</p>

  <p>It is called the "Breeches Bible" from the rendering of Genesis, iii.
  7.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Then the eyes of them bothe were opened, and they knewe that they
  were naked, and they sewed fig tree leaves together, and made themselves
  breeches."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The first edition of the Geneva Bible was printed at Geneva in 1562,
  folio, preceded by a dedication to Queen Elizabeth, and an address "To
  our beloved in the lord the brethren of England, Scotland, Ireland,"
  &amp;c.; dated from Geneva, 10th April, 1561. This edition contains two
  remarkable errors: Matt. v. 9. "Blessed are the <i>place</i> makers."
  Luke xxi. "Chris <i>condemneth</i> the poor widow." This is the first
  Bible divided into verses.</p>

  <p>Second edit. 4to., printed at Geneva, 1569. To this edition is added
  "Certeine Tables, A Calendar, and Fairs in Fraunce and elsewhere."</p>

  <p>The first edition printed in London is a small folio. Imprinted by
  Christopher Barker, 1576.</p>

  <p>The first edition of the Scriptures printed in Scotland is the Geneva
  version, folio, began 1576, by Thomas Bassandyne; and finished in 1579 by
  Alexander Arbuthnot.</p>

  <p>Other editions, 1577, London, sm. fol.; 1578, sm. fol.; 4to., 1579;
  two editions 4to., 1580, 1581; sm. fol.; 1582; 4to., 1583; lar. fol.,
  1583; 4to., 1585; 4to., 1586; 8vo., 1586; 4to., 1587; 4to., 1588; 4to.,
  1589; 8vo., Cambridge, 1591, supposed to be first printed at the
  university; fol., 1592; 4to., 1594; 4to., 1595; fol., 1595; 4to., 1597;
  sm. fol., 1597; 4to., 1598; 4to., 1599. Of this last date, said to be
  "Imprinted at London by the deputies of Chr. Barker," but probably
  printed at Dort, and other places in Holland, there were at least seven
  editions; and, before 1611, there were at least twenty other
  editions.</p>

  <p>Between the years 1562 and 1611, there were printed at least 130
  editions of the Geneva Bible, in folio, 4to., and 8vo.; each edition
  probably consisted of 1000 copies.</p>

  <p>Persons who know but little of the numbers which are extant of this
  volume, have asked 100<i>l.</i>, <!-- Page 18 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page18"></a>{18}</span> 30<i>l.</i>, and other like sums, for a
  copy; whereas, as many shillings is about the value of the later
  editions.</p>

  <p>The notes by the Reformers from the margin of the Geneva version, have
  been reprinted with what is usually called King James' version, the one
  now in use, in the editions printed at Amsterdam, at the beginning of the
  seventeenth century.</p>

<h3>POEMS DISCOVERED AMONG THE PAPERS OF SIR KENELM DIGBY.</h3>

  <p>MR. HALLIWELL (Vol. ii., p. 238.) says that he does not believe my MS.
  of the "Minde of the Lady Venetia Digby" can be an autograph. I have
  reason to think that he is right from discovering another MS. written in
  the same hand as the above, and containing two poems without date or
  signature, neither of which (I <i>believe</i>) are Ben Jonson's. I
  enclose the shorter of the two, and should feel obliged if any of your
  correspondents could tell me the author of it, as this would throw some
  light upon the <i>writer</i> of the two MSS.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i4">THE HOURGLASSE.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Doe but consider this small dust running in this glasse,</p>
      <p class="i2">By atoms moved;</p>
      <p>Would you believe that this the body ever was</p>
      <p class="i2">Of one that loved;</p>
      <p>Who in his mistresse flames playing like a fly,</p>
      <p class="i2">Burnt to cinders by her eye?</p>
      <p>Yes! and in death as life unblest,</p>
      <p class="i2">To have it exprest</p>
      <p>Even ashes of lovers have no rest.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>I also enclose a copy of another poem I have discovered, which appears
  to me very curious, and, from the date, written the very year of the
  visit of Prince Charles and Buckingham to the court of Spain. Has it ever
  been printed, and who is the author?</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">

  <p>From London, 31. Martii, 1623.</p>

  <p>Prefaced to this poem is an extract from a letter of Buckingham's to
  his wife, containing an account of their reception: but it is hardly
  worth copying.</p>

<h3>WORKS OF CAMOENS.</h3>

  <p>Having been requested by a foreign nobleman to furnish him with a list
  of the editions of the works of Camoens, and of the various translations,
  I have prepared one; and considering the information might be interesting
  to several of your readers, I send you a copy for insertion It besides
  affords an opportunity of asking after those editions, to which I have
  added the observations. The first star indicates that the works are in my
  private collection, as are several other works relating to that
  celebrated poet. Obras means the collected works.</p>

  <p><i>Folk Lore of Wales</i>: <i>Shewri-while.</i>&mdash;There is a
  legend connected with one of the Monmouthshire mountains (<i>Mynydd
  Llanhilleth</i>), that was, until very recently, implicitly believed by
  most of the residents in that neighbourhood. They stated that the
  mountain was haunted by a spirit in the form of a woman, and known by the
  name of "Shewri-while." Her principal employment appears to have been
  misleading those whose business or inclination led them across the
  mountain; and so powerful was her influence, that few, even of those who
  resided in the neighbourhood, could cross the mountain without losing
  their way. If some unlucky wanderer hesitated in which direction to go,
  Shewri would attract his attention by a loud "whoo-whoop," and with
  upraised arm beckon him on. If followed, she glided on before him:
  sometimes allowing him to approach so near, that the colour and
  arrangement of her dress could be distinguished; at other times, she
  would only be seen at a distance, and then she frequently repeated her
  call of "whoo-whoop." At length, after wandering over the mountain for
  hours in the hope of overtaking her, she would leave her weary and
  bewildered pursuer at the very spot from which he had first started.</p>

  <p>The last-named gift consisted of gold five-guinea pieces of Charles
  II. and James II., some of which have been preserved in the family. The
  part of the record, however, which appears to me worthy of note, is that
  which concerns the <i>quinces</i>, which brings to one's mind the ancient
  Greek custom that the bridegroom and bride should eat a <i>quince</i>
  together, as a part of the wedding ceremonies. (See Potter's <i>Grecian

<h3>ELIZABETH WALKER.&mdash;SHAKSPEARE.</h3>

  <p>I have before me a reprint (Blackwell, Sheffield, 1829) of <i>The Holy
  Life of Mrs. Elizabeth Walker, late Wife of A. Walker, D.D., Rector of
  Fyfield, in Essex</i>, originally published by her husband in 1690. It is
  a beautiful record of that sweet, simple, and earnest piety which
  characterised many of the professors of religion in the seventeenth
  century. It is not, however, the general character of the book, however
  excellent, but an incidental allusion in the first section of it, that
  suggests this communication. The good woman above named, and who was born
  in London in 1623, says, in her Diary:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"My dear father was John Sadler, a very eminent citizen. He was born
  at Stratford-upon-Avon, where his ancestors lived. My grandfather had a
  good estate in and about the town. He was of a free and noble spirit,
  which somewhat outreached his estate, but was not given to any debauchery
  that I ever heard of. My father's mother was a very wise, pious, and good
  woman, and lived and died a good Christian. My father had no brother, but
  three sisters who were all eminently wise and good women, especially his
  youngest sister."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It is, I confess, very agreeable to me, amidst the interest of
  association created by the world-wide fame of the "Swan of Avon," to
  record this pleasing tribute to the character of the <i>genius loci</i>
  at so interesting a period. In a passage on a subsequent page, Mrs.
  Walker, referring to some spiritual troubles, says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"My father's sister, my dear aunt Quiney, a gracious good woman,
  taking notice of my dejected spirit, she waylaid me in my coming home
  from the morning exercise then in our parish."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This was in London: but it is impossible to have read attentively some
  of the minuter memorials of Shakspeare (<i>e.g.</i> Hunter's,
  Halliwell's, &amp;c.) without recognising in "Aunt Quiney" a collateral
  relationship to the immortal bard himself. I am not aware that any
  Shakspearian reader of the "NOTES AND QUERIES" will feel the slightest
  interest in this remote branch of a genealogical tree, which seems to
  have borne "diverse manner of fruits;" but assuredly the better portion
  of those who most justly admire its exuberance of dramatic yield, will
  not disparage their taste should they equally relish the evangelical
  flavour of its "holier products," exemplified in the Life of Mrs.
  Elizabeth Walker.</p>

<h3>OLD ENGLISH ACTORS AND MUSICIANS IN GERMANY.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;">(Vol. ii., pp. 184. 459.)</p>

  <p>The following extracts furnish decisive evidence of the custom of our
  old English actors' and musicians' professional peregrinations on the
  continent at the beginning of the seventeenth century&mdash;a subject
  which has been ably treated by Mr. Thoms in the <i>Athenæum</i> for 1849,
  p. 862.</p>

  <p>In September, 1603, King James I. despatched the Lord Spenser and Sir
  William Dethick, Garter King-at-arms, to Stuttgart, for the purpose of
  investing the Duke of Würtemberg with the ensigns of the Garter, he
  having been elected into the order in the 39th year of the late Queen's
  reign. A description of this important ceremony was published at Tubingen
  in 1605, in a 4to. volume of 270 pages, by Erhardus Cellius, professor of
  poetry and history at that University, entitled: "Eques auratus
  Anglo-Wirtembergicus." At page 120. we are told that among the
  ambassador's retinue were "four excellent musicians, with ten other
  assistants." (Four excellentes musici, unà cum decem ministris aliis.)
  These performed at a grand banquet given after the Duke's investiture,
  and are described at p. 229. as "the royal English music, which the
  illustrious royal ambassador had brought with him to enhance the
  magnificence of the embassy and the present ceremony; and who, though few
  in number, were eminently well skilled in the art. For England produces
  many excellent musicians, commedians, and tragedians, most skilful in the
  histrionic art; certain companies of whom quitting their own abodes for a
  time, are in the habit of visiting foreign countries at particular
  seasons, exhibiting and representing their art principally at the courts
  of princes. A few years ago, some English musicians coming over to our
  Germany with this view, remained for some time at the courts of great
  princes; their skill both in music and in the histrionic art, having
  procured them such favour, that they returned home beautifully rewarded,
  and loaded with gold and silver."</p>

  <p>(Musica Anglicana Regiæ, quam Regius illustris Legatus secum ad
  Legationis et actus huius magnificentiam adduxerat: non ita multos quidem
  sed excellenter in hac arte versatos. Profert enim multos et præstantes
  Anglia musicos, com&#339;dos, tragædos, histrionicæ peritissimos, è
  quibus interdum aliquot consociati sedibus <!-- Page 22 --><span

  ad exteras nationes excurrere, artemq'; suam illis præsertim Principum
  aulis demonstrare, ostentareq'; consueverunt. Paucis ab hinc annis in
  Germaniam nostram Anglicani musici dictum ob finem expaciati, et in
  magnorum Principum aulis aliquandiu versati, tantum ex arte musica,
  histrionicaq'; sibi favorem conciliârunt, ut largiter remunerati domum
  inde auro et argento onusti sint reversi.)</p>

  <p>Dancing succeeded the feast and then (p. 244.) "the English players
  made their appearance, and represented the sacred history of
  <i>Susanna</i>, with so much art of histrionic action, and with such
  dexterity, that they obtained both praise and a most ample reward."</p>

  <p>(Histriones Anglicani maturè prodibant, et sacram Susannæ historiam
  tanta actionis histrionicæ arte, tanta dexteritate representabant, ut et
  laudem inde et præmium amplissimum reportarent.)</p>

<h3>MINOR NOTES.</h3>

  <p><i>The Curse of Scotland.</i>&mdash;In Vol. i. p. 61., is a Query why
  the Nine of Diamonds is called the Curse of Scotland. Reference is made
  to a print dated Oct. 21, 1745, entitled "Briton's Association against
  the Pope's Bulls," in which the young Pretender is represented attempting
  to lead across the Tweed a herd of bulls laden with curses,
  excommunications, indulgences, &amp;c.: on the ground before them lies
  the Nine of Diamonds. In p. 90. it is said that the "Curse of Scotland"
  is a corruption of the "Cross of Scotland," and that the allusion is to
  St. Andrew's cross, which is supposed to resemble the Nine of Diamonds.
  This explanation is unsatisfactory. The <i>nine</i> resembles St.
  Andrew's cross less than the <i>five</i>, in a pack of cards; and,
  moreover, the nine of any other suit would be equally applicable. The
  true explanation is evidently to be found in the game of Pope Joan, in
  which the Nine of Diamonds is the pope. The well-known antipapal spirit
  of the Scottish people caused the pope to be called the Curse of
  Scotland.</p>

  <p>The game of Pope Joan is stated to have been originally called Pope
  Julio, and to be as old as the reign of Queen Elizabeth. See Sir John
  Harington's "Treatise on Playe," written about 1597, Nugæ Antiquæ, vol.
  i. p. 220.</p>

  <p><i>George Herbert.</i>&mdash;It is much to be desired that the
  suggestion thrown out by your correspondent (Vol. ii., p. 460.) may be
  acted upon. The admirers of George Herbert are doubtless so numerous,
  that the correct and complete restoration of Bemerton Church might be
  effected by means of a small subscription among them, as in the case of
  the Chaucer monument. Most gladly would I aid in the good work.</p>

  <p><i>Errors in the Date of Printed Books.</i>&mdash;In the title-page of
  Peter Heylin's <i>Microcosmos</i>, 8th ed., the date is printed 1939
  instead of 1639. In like manner, in <i>Historical Applications and
  occasional Meditations upon several Subjects, written by a Person of
  Honour</i>, printed in 1670, the imprimatur, signed "Sam. Parker," is
  dated 1970, instead of 1670. In each of these cases the error is
  evidently caused by the compositor having inverted the figure 6, which
  thus became 9.</p>

<h2>QUERIES.</h2>

<h3>DOUSA'S POEM ON SIDNEY.&mdash;OLD DUTCH SONG-BOOK.</h3>

  <p>Your correspondent, who subscribes himself JANUS DOUSA in the last
  number of "NOTES AND QUERIES," ought to be able, and I dare say will be
  able, to supply through your columns information of which I have been
  long in search. In 1586 his great namesake printed at Lugd. Batav. a
  collection of Greek and Latin poems upon dead and living persons of
  distinction. Geoffrey Whitney, an Englishman, apparently residing at
  Leyden, and <!-- Page 23 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page23"></a>{23}</span> who printed two works there in his own
  language, has fifteen six-line stanzas preceding Dousa's collection, and
  he subjoins to it a translation of a copy of Dousa's verses on the Earl
  of Leicester. Of these I have a memorandum, and they are not what I want;
  but what I am at a loss for is a copy of verses by Dousa, in the same
  volume, upon Sir Philip Sidney. It is many years since I saw the book,
  and I am not sure if there be not two copies of verses to Sidney, in
  which he is addressed as <i>Princeps</i>; and if your correspondent can
  furnish me with either, or both, I shall be much obliged to him.</p>

  <p>Will you allow me to put another question relating to an old Dutch
  song-book that has lately fallen in my way; and though I can hardly
  expect a man like JANUS DOUSA to know anything about such a trifle, it is
  on some accounts a matter of importance to me, in connection with two
  early English songs, and one or other of your many friends may not object
  to aid me. The book is called <i>De zingende Lootsman of de Vrolyke
  Boer</i>, and it professes to be the <i>tweede druk</i>: the imprint is
  <i>Te Amsteldam By S. en W. Koene, Boekdrukkers, Boek en
  Papierverkoopers, op de Linde Gragt</i>. The information I request is the
  date of the work, for I can find none; and whether any <i>first part</i>
  of it is known in England, and where?</p>

  <p>You are probably aware that the Dutch adopted not a few of our early
  tunes, and they translated also some of our early songs. These I am
  anxious to trace.</p>

  anxious to refer to it at a future opportunity. But, although I have
  again and again searched through the Catalogues, and made anxious
  inquiries of the attendants in the reading-room, I have never yet been
  able to catch a glimpse of it. Can any of your correspondents furnish me
  with the correct title, and state whether it is still preserved in this
  national library?</p>

  <p><i>Invention of Steam Power.</i>&mdash;The following doggerel is the

  <p><i>Mythology of the Stars.</i>&mdash;I want (in perfect <!-- Page 24
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page24"></a>{24}</span> ignorance
  whether there is such a book) a "Mythology of the Stars." Considering how
  often persons of sound mind express an enthusiasm for the celestial
  bodies, and exclaim, of clear night, that the stars are the poetry of
  Heaven, it is wonderful how little most of us know about them. Nine out
  of ten educated persons would be quite unable to do more than point out
  the Great Bear and North Star.</p>

  <p>If there is not, there <i>ought</i> to be, some collection of the
  nomenclature and mythological history of the heavens, with a familiar
  treatise on astrology ancient and modern. The Chaldeans, Egyptians,
  Grecians, Arabs, Celts, and Norsemen, must have had names and stories,
  whose relation (both in itself and to one another) would make a very
  pretty volume either of poetry or prose. Perhaps some of your readers may
  be able to inform me of such a work, or where detached masses of the
  information I want could be found.</p>

  <p><i>Neville Family.</i>&mdash;Will any of your correspondents inform me
  what family of the Nevilles were connected by marriage with the
  Fleetwoods or Cromwells?</p>

  <p>In a collateral note in my family pedigree, I find it stated, that
  Sarah Neville (who married Thomas Burkitt, in 1683) was cousin to General
  Charles Fleetwood, who married Bridget Cromwell, daughter of the
  Protector; and, on the cover of a book, I find written&mdash;</p>

  <p>I have also traditional testimony in possessing a valuable cabinet,

  both of which have been preserved in the family for more than a century
  and a half, and supposed to have passed into their possession by the
  marriage of Sarah Neville.</p>

  p. 160.), speaking of this interesting volume, says:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Her Grace was so good as to let me read them, and I read them with

<h2>REPLIES.</h2>

<h3>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL QUERIES BY R.G.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;">(Vol. ii., p. 422.).</p>

  <p><i>Pagnini's Bible.</i>&mdash;I have before me a 12mo. copy of
  <i>Liber Psalmorum Davidis. Tr&#257;latio Duplex Vetus et Nova</i>. It
  contains also the Songs of Moses, Deborah, etc., with annotations. In the
  title-page, the new translation is said to be that of Pagnini. It was
  printed by Robert Stephens, and is dated on the title-page "1556," and in
  the colophon "1557, cal. Jan."</p>

  <p>In this edition, both the old and new versions have the <i>verses
  distinguished by cyphers</i> (numerals). I have not the means of knowing
  whether, in the earlier editions of Pagnini's Bible, the verses are so
  distinguished; but I gather from R.G. that they are.</p>

  <p>The writer of the article "BIBLE" in Rees's <i>Cyclopædia</i>, says
  that R. Stephens reprinted Pagnini's Bible in folio, with the Vulgate, in
  1557. And it appears, from my copy of the Psalms of David, that he also
  printed that part of Pagnini's Bible in 12mo. in the same year,
  1557&mdash;the colophon probably containing the correct date.</p>

  <p>Your pages have recommended that communications should be made of MS.
  notes and remarks found in fly-leaves, margins, etc. of printed books;
  and the above is written, partly in confirmation of Pagnini's title to
  the honour of distinguishing the verses of the Bible with cyphers, as
  suggested by R.G., but chiefly to note that there is written with a pen,
  in my copy, the word "Vetus" over the column which contains the old, or
  Vulgate, and the words "Pagnini <i>sive</i> Ariæ Montani" over the column
  containing the new version of the first psalm.</p>

  <p>The writer in Rees's <i>Cyclopædia</i>, above referred to, says, that
  "in the number of Latin Bibles is also usually ranked the version of the
  same Pagninus, corrected, or rather rendered literal by <!-- Page 25
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page25"></a>{25}</span> Arias
  Montanus." But in the title-page of my copy Montanus is not
  mentioned.</p>

  <p>My copy belonged to Jo. Sheldrake (who was he?) in 1663; to D. Hughes,
  of Queen's College, Cambridge, in 1761; and to E. Tymewell Bridges (as
  the family name was then spelled) in 1777. The latter was a brother of
  the late Sir S. Egerton Br<i>y</i>dges. But the MS. note above mentioned
  does not seem to be in the handwriting of either of them.</p>

  <p>Will some learned reader of your work let me know whether there be
  any, and what ground for attributing the new translation, as it stands in
  this volume, to Montanus; or as Pagnini's corrected by Montanus?</p>

<h3>THE FROZEN HORN.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;">(Vol. ii., p. 262.)</p>

  <p>The quotation from Heylin is good; "the amusing anecdote from
  Munchausen" may be better; but the personal testimony of Sir John
  Mandeville is best of all, and, if I am not mistaken, as true a
  traveller's lie as ever was told. Many years ago I met with an extract
  from his antiquated volume, of which, having preserved no copy, I cannot
  give the admirable verbiage of the fourteenth century, but must submit
  for it the following tame translation in the flat English of our
  degenerate days.</p>

  <p>He testifies that once, on his voyage through the Arctic regions, lat.
  ***, long. ***, the cold was so intense, that for a while whatever was
  spoken on board the vessel became frost-bound, and remained so, till,
  after certain days, there came a sudden thaw, which let loose the whole
  rabblement of sounds and syllables that had been accumulating during the
  suspense of audible speech; but now fell clattering down like hailstones
  about the ears of the crew, not less to their annoyance than the embargo
  had been to their dismay. Among the unlucky revelations at this
  denouement, the author gravely states that a rude fellow (the boatswain,
  I think), having cursed the knight himself in a fit of passion, his sin
  then found him out, and was promptly visited by retributive justice, in
  the form of a sound flogging. If this salutary moral of the fable be not
  proof sufficient to authenticate both the fact in natural history, and
  the veracity of the narrator, I know nothing in the world of evidence
  that could do so. It may be added, that the author of <i>Hudibras</i>, in
  his significant manner, alludes to the popular belief of such an
  atmospheric phenomenon in the following couplet:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Where Truth in person doth appear,</p>
      <p>Like words congeal'd in northern air."</p>
      <p class="i8"><i>Hudibras</i>, Book i. Canto i.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It is possible that Zachary Grey, in his copiously illustrated edition
  of the poem, may have quoted Sir John Mandeville's account of this
  notable adventure, in his wanderings, like a true knight-errant, through
  Scythia, Armenia, Egypt, Arabia, Syria, Media, Persia, Chaldea, Greece,
  Dalmatia, Belgium, &amp;c. He wrote an Itinerary of his travels in
  English, French, and Latin. In these he occupied nearly forty years, and
  was long supposed to have died in the course of them, but (as if his
  person had been "congealed in northern air" and suddenly thawed into warm
  life again) when he re-appeared, his friends with difficulty recognised
  him.</p>

<h3>DOMINICALS</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;">(Vol. ii., p 154.)</p>

  <p>I believe to have been that kind of customary payment or oblations
  made <i>on Sundays</i> to the rector, or his vicegerent, of the church
  where a person heard divine service and received the sacraments:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Hostiensis dicit quod in præcipuis festivitatibus tenetur quis
  offerre, et <i>cogi potest</i>; maximè cum sit quasi <i>generalis
  consuetudo ubique terrarum</i> ... et intelligit festivitates præcipuas,
  <i>dies Dominicos</i>, et alios dies festivos."&mdash;Lyndwood,
  <i>Prov.</i>, p. 21., not. e., ed. Oxon. 1679.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Though Lyndwood himself, as I understand him, seems to doubt the
  cardinal's statement, that the payment could be <i>enforced</i>, unless
  sanctioned by local custom.</p>

  <p>Ducange, in v. "Denarius," 8vo. ed., Adel. 1774, says, the "Denarius
  de Palmâ" and "Denarius Dominicalis" were the same:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Habebit (vicarius) cum eis victum suum competentem, et ad vestes sibi
  emendas XL. solidos Andegavenses, et <i>Denarium singulis diebus
  Dominicis ecclesiasticâ consuetudine offerendum</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>On this extract from a charter he observes:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Erat itaque <i>Denarius de Palmâ</i>, ille qui singulis Diebus
  Dominicis et [lege à] fidelibus offerrebatur. Cur autem dictus 'de Palmâ'
  non constat, nisi forte sic dictus fuerit quod in manum seu <i>palmam</i>
  traderetur." <i>Denarius Dominicalis</i>, idem.&mdash;Arest. MS. a.
  1407.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It would seem also from his definition to be the same as the payment
  called "Denaria Sacramentorum," that is:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"iidem denarii qui <i>singulis offerrebantur Dominicis</i>, ideoque
  Sacramentorum dicti, quod tempore Sacrosancti Missæ Sacrificii, pro
  excellentiâ interdum nudè appellati Sacramentum, a fidelibus
  offerrentur."&mdash;<i>Annal. Bened.</i>, t. iv. p. 466., n. 80. ad annum
  1045.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>These extracts sufficiently explain, perhaps, the payment known by the
  different names of "Dominicals," "Palm-penny," and "Sacrament-pence;" and
  still indicated, probably, by the weekly offertory of our communion
  service.</p>

  <p>Of a kindred nature were the "Denarii pro Requestis," or "Denarii
  perquisiti," sometimes also <!-- Page 26 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page26"></a>{26}</span> called "Denarii memoriales," pence paid for
  masses in memory of the dead: called "pro requestis," because they were
  obtained by special petition [requesta] from the curate; and
  "perquisiti," "perquisite pence," because they were demanded
  [perquirebantur] from the devotion of the parishioners, over and above
  the customary offerings. And in this, perhaps, we find the origin of our
  word "perquisite." (Lyndw. <i>Prov.</i> p. 111., notes c, e. and p.
  237.)</p>

  <p>In further illustration of this subject, I will quote the following
  note from Mr. Dansey's learned work <i>Horæ Decanicæ Rurales</i>, vol.
  i., p. 426., ed. 1844, which refers also to Blomefield's <i>Norfolk</i>,
  vol. iv. p. 63.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"A.D. 1686. The dean of the deanery of the city of Norwich was

  exacting <i>hallidays toll</i> by his sub-dean in too high a manner; but
  on his proving that he took of every great boat that came up to the city
  on a holiday 1<i>d.</i> only, and of each small one a <i>halfpenny</i>;
  of every cart 1<i>d.</i>, and of every horse or man laden an
  <i>halfpenny</i>; and of all bakers, butchers, and fishmongers, that sold

<h3>MEDAL STRUCK BY CHARLES XII.&mdash;RUDBECK'S ATLANTICA.</h3>

  <p>Although no numismatist, yet, being resident at Stockholm, I have
  taken steps to enable me to reply to L.'s Query (Vol. ii., p. 408. of
  "NOTES AND QUERIES") respecting Charles XII.'s medal in commemoration of
  the victory at Holowzin.</p>

  <p>No copy of the medal exists in the cabinet of the Royal Museum of
  Antiquities; but in that belonging to the National Bank, there is a very
  fine example of it in copper, and the inscriptions are as follow:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  Voltaire and criticised by L.</p>

  <p>The same inscriptions are given in Bergh's <i>Beskrifning öfver
  Svenska mynt och Skädepenningar</i>, 4to., Upsala, 1773; only he adds,

<h3>REPLIES TO MINOR QUERIES.</h3>

  <p><i>Fossil Deer (not Elk) of Ireland, C. Megaceros</i> (Vol. ii., p.
  494.).&mdash;Your correspondent W.R.C. will find in Mr. Hart's
  description of a skeleton of this animal (Dublin, 1825), in a pamphlet,
  published by W. Richardson (Dublin, 1846, M'Glashan), in Professor Owen's
  <i>British Fossil Mammalia</i>, and in the <i>Zoologist</i> (Van Voorst)
  for 1847 and for 1848, p. 2064., all that is known and much that has been
  imagined on the subject of his inquiry. The rib which he mentions is well
  known, and is in fact one of the principal bones of contention between
  the opposing theorists. I never before heard the story of the specimen
  shot in 1533, although several years ago I devoted some time to the
  subject. I am inclined to suspect that it must have been found in some
  Irish manuscript which has been discovered, since (in the year 1847) some
  bones of the fossil deer were found in a certain <!-- Page 27 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page27"></a>{27}</span> lake in the west of
  Ireland in company with those of a turkey. (See <i>Zoologist</i>, ub.

  <p>"<i>Away, let nought to Love displeasing</i>" (Vol. ii., p.
  519.).&mdash;This song, usually entitled "<i>Winifreda</i>," has been
  attributed to Sir John Suckling, but with what justice I am unable to
  say.</p>

  <p>It has also acquired additional interest from having been set to music
  by the first Earl of Mornington, the father of the Duke of
  Wellington.</p>

  <p>The author should certainly be known; and perhaps some of your
  correspondents can furnish a clue by which he may be discovered.</p>

  <p><i>Coleridge and the Penny Post</i> (Vol. iii., p. 6.).&mdash;Mr.
  Venables asks a question in a way that may lead the reader to infer an
  answer, and an ungenerous answer; and he calls on Mr. Hill to give him
  satisfaction, as if Mr. Hill had nothing better to do than to inform Mr.
  Venables, and correct Miss Martineau's blunders. If Mr. Venables had
  taken an active part in bringing about the greatest moral movement of our
  age, he would have known that, amongst the hundred other illustrations
  adduced by Mr. Hill, was the very anecdote to which he refers; and that
  Mr. Hill quoted it, not once or twice, but dozens of times, and
  circulated it, with Coleridge's name, over the whole length and breadth
  of the three kingdoms, by tens of thousands of printed papers. Mr. Hill
  has not had a tithe of the honour he deserves&mdash;and never will
  have&mdash;and I cannot remain silent, and see his character questioned,
  though in matters too trifling, I think, even to have occupied a corner
  in "NOTES AND QUERIES."</p>

  <p><i>Circulation of the Blood</i> (Vol. ii., p. 475.).&mdash;The passage
  in Venerable Bede referred to by J.MN. may have been in a tract <i>De
  Minutione Sanguinis sive de Phlebotomia</i>; (which occurs in the folio
  editions, Basle, vol. i. p. 472.; Colon., vol. i. p. 898.). In the

  says,&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>True Blue</i> (Vol. ii., p. 494.).&mdash;From documents relative to
  the wars of the Scottish Covenanters, in the seventeenth century, it
  appears that they assumed <i>blue ribbons</i> as their colours, and wore
  them as scarfs, or in bunches fastened to their <i>blue bonnets</i> and
  that the border English nicknamed them "<i>blue caps</i>" and "jockies."

  <p><i>Darcy Lever Church</i> (Vol. ii., p. 494.), which is referred to by
  your correspondent, is the first instance, I believe, of the application
  of a new material to the construction of an ecclesiastical edifice. It is
  built throughout, walls, tower, and spire, benches and fittings, of terra
  cotta from the Ladyshore works. The architect is that accomplished
  antiquary, Mr. Sharpe of Lancaster, who furnished the designs of every
  part, from which moulds were made, and in these the composition forming
  the terra cotta was prepared, and hardened by the application of fire.
  The style is the purest and richest Second Pointed, and the effect of the
  pierced work of the spire is, as your correspondent observes, very fine
  when seen from a distance. There is a rich colour, too, in the material,
  which has a remarkably pleasing result upon the eye. But a nearer
  approach destroys the charm. It is found to be a "sham." The lines of the
  mouldings, mullions, etc., are warped by the heat attendant upon the
  process of the manufacture. The exquisite sharpness of outline produced
  by the chisel is wanting, and there is (in consequence of the
  impossibility of undercutting) an absence of that effect of light and
  shade which is the characteristic of the mediæval carvings. The greatest
  shock is, however, experienced on an examination of the interior. What at
  first sight appear to be highly elaborated oaken bench-ends and seats are
  only painted earthenware. In point of fact, it is a POT CHURCH. A similar
  and larger <!-- Page 28 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page28"></a>{28}</span> structure by the same architect, and in the
  same material, has been erected near Platt Hall, in the parish of
  Manchester.</p>

  <p class="author">J.H.P. LERESCHE.</p>

  <p>The church at Lever Bridge, near Darcy Lever Hall, on the line of
  railway between Normanton and Bolton, was built about seven years since.
  The architect is Edward Sharpe, Esq., of Lancaster. The material of the
  entire structure, including the internal fittings, is terra cotta, from
  the Ladyshore works in the neighbourhood, where a model of the church, in
  the same material, is in preparation for the Exhibition of 1851.</p>

  <p>A friend, who was senior medallist in his time at Cambridge, tells me
  that tradition said that the lines were set by the Rev. R. Collier,
  Hebrew Professor and Examiner at Trinity College; and that it is supposed
  that Collier found them in some magazine of the day.</p>

  <p>With reference to the imposition supposed to be set Porson (Vol. ii.,
  p. 71.), and shown by C. at p. 106. to be by Joshua Barnes, I question
  whether any imposition were ever set him: for I have heard Mr. Summers
  (Porson's first instructor) observe, that he was a well-conducted man
  during the whole of his undergraduateship; others have reported the same
  of him.</p>

  <p>The lessor, Christopher Ratlife, of Hewick, died before 10 Henry VII.,
  and the editor of the above work says, "It is impossible to account for
  the peculiarity in the date of this deed."</p>

  <p>Bishop Burnet cites Spelman as asserting that several of the kings of
  England before Henry VIII. had borne the title of "Defender of the
  Faith." A correspondent of the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> (N.S. xvi.
  357.) conjectures that the name of Spelman had been inadvertently
  substituted for the name of Selden; though he justly remarks, that Selden
  by no means countenances the assertion of the bishop.</p>

  <p><i>Farquharson on Auroræ</i> (Vol. ii., p. 441.).&mdash;Your
  correspondant L. inquires about Mr. Farquharson, <i>shepherd</i> or
  <i>minister</i> of Alford. Whether the word translated <i>shepherd</i> be
  <i>pasteur</i> or not, I cannot say, as I have not either of the works he
  alludes to; but certain it is that the Rev. Mr. Farquharson,
  <i>minister</i> of Alford, only recently deceased, was well known as a
  meteorological observer; and it is to him, doubtless, that Professor
  K&#339;nitz refers.</p>

  <p><i>Tale of a Tub</i> (Vol. i., p.326.).&mdash;Your correspondant
  J.O.W.H. may find some curious remarks on this subject in Sir James
  Mackintosh's <i>Life of Sir Thomas More</i>. I cannot give a precise
  reference; but as the book is small, the passages may be easily
  found.</p>

  <p class="author">H.G.T.</p>

  <p><i>Painting by C. Bega</i> (Vol. ii., p. 494.).&mdash;The translation
  of the lines is, I believe,</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"We Sing certainly what is new, and have still a prize." "A Cracknel
  is our gain, but the ditty must first (come) out."</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Wÿ singen vast wat nienw, en hebben nog een buit. Een Krakeling is
  onze winst maar het Liedker moet eerst uit."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I should think there is a lake somewhere in the picture, and the lines
  are probably part of an old Dutch song. As to the painter C. Bega, I have
  at hand a Catalogue of the Munich Gallery, and find there "Cornelius
  Bega, geb. 1620, gest. 1664." His picture is described as "Eine Rauch-
  und Trinkgesellschaft belustiget sich mit Tanz in einer Schenke." In a
  Catalogue of the Louvre, I have the following description:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Bega, Corneille ou Cornille, né à Harlem en 1620, mort de la peste
  dans la même ville en 1664; élève d'Adrien Van Ostade."</p>

  <p>His picture is</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Intérieur d'un ménage rustique. Un homme et une femme sont assis près
  d'une table."</p>

  possessed by your correspondent.</p>

  <p><i>Herstmonceux</i> (Vol. ii., p. 478.).&mdash;Question 4. In the
  Privy Seal writs of Henry V. frequent mention is made of "nostre maison
  de Bethleem," a Monastery at Shene, so called because it was dedicated to
  "Jesus of Bethlehem." It was for forty monks of the Cistercian order.</p>

  <p>Question 5. In the <i>Battle of Agincourt</i>, by Sir H. Nicolas, Sir
  Rover Fyene's name is given amongst the retinue of Henry V. He was
  accompanied by eight men-at-arms and twenty-four archers. Sir Roger
  "Ffynys," accompanied by ten of his men-at-arms and forty archers, also
  followed Henry (in the suite of Lord Willoughby d'Eresby) in his second
  continental expedition. (<i>Gesta Henrici Quinti.</i>)</p>

  <p><i>Midwives Licensed</i> (Vol. ii., p. 408.).&mdash;I find the
  following question among the articles of inquiry issued by Fleetwood, Bp.
  of St. Asaph, in the year 1710.</p>

  <p>"Did you ever look at a book written by Wilson, a Scotchman, under the

</div>

  <p><i>Martin Family</i> (Vol. ii., p. 392.).&mdash;CLERICUS asks for
  information touching the family of Martin, "in or near Wivenhoe, Essex."
  There is a large house in the village, said to have been the seat of
  Matthew Martin, Esq., member for Colchester in the second parliaments of
  George I. and II. He died in 1749. He had been a commander in the service
  of the East India Company. Only one party of the name now lives in the
  neighbourhood, but whether he is of the family or not I cannot say. He is
  described as "Edward Martin, Master, Royal Navy."</p>

  <p><i>Swords used in Dress</i> (Vol. i. 415.; vol. ii. 110. 213.
  388.).&mdash;Might it not have happened that swords went out of fashion
  after the middle of the last century, and were revived towards its close?
  In old prints from 1700 to 1720, they appear to have been universally
  worn; later they are not so general. In 1776-90, they appear again. My
  grandmother (born in 1760) well remembers her brother, of nearly her own
  age, wearing a sword, say about 1780. Some of Fielding's heroes wore
  "hangers."</p>

  <p class="author">A.A.</p>

  <p><i>Clerical Costume</i> (Vol. ii., pp. 22. 189.).&mdash;The use of
  scarlet cloth is popularly recommended in Berks and in Devon as a cure
  for the rheumatism. It should be wrapped round the "ailing" limb.</p>

  <p class="author">GOMER.</p>

  <p><i>Swearing by Swans</i> (Vol. ii., pp. 392. 451.).&mdash;Though I can
  give no reason why the birds of Juno should have been invoked as
  witnesses to an oath, the Query about them has suggested to me what may
  perhaps appear rather an irrelevant little note.</p>

  <p>Cooper, in his <i>Raven's Nest</i>, makes Mr. Aristobulus Brag use the
  provincialism "<i>I swanny</i>;" "by which," observes the author, "I
  suppose he meant&mdash;<i>I swear!</i>" Of course, this has nothing to do
  with swearing by swans, more than sounding like it; argument of sound
  being very different from sound argument. Mr. Cooper does not seem to
  have given a thought to the analysis of the phrase, which is no oath,
  merely an innocent asseveration. "I's-a-warrant-ye" (perhaps when
  resolved to its ungrammatical elements, "I is a warranty to ye") proceeds
  through "I's-a-warnd-ye," "I's-warn-ye" (all English provincialisms,) to
  its remote transatlantic ultimatum of debasement in "<i>I
  swanny</i>."</p>

  others:&mdash;"Take a feather dipt in spirits of wine, and lightly wash
  over the backs and covers. To prevent mould, put a little into writing

  <p>Another to take <i>mildew out of linen</i>.&mdash;"Mix powdered starch

  due to your correspondent S.S.S. for kindly furnishing information as to
  the singular arched passage mentioned in a former note, which drew my
  attention as a casual visitor, and which <!-- Page 30 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page30"></a>{30}</span> certainly appears to be
  the "iter processionale" referred to in the will of William Ryder. Any
  information as to the subject of the good woman's tradition would be very
  acceptable. Perhaps S.S.S. will allow me, in return for his satisfactory
  explanation of the "dark passage" in question, to over a very luminous
  passage in confirmation of his view of Goldsmith's.</p>

  <p><i>Time when Herodotus wrote</i> (Vol. ii., p. 405.).&mdash;The
  passage quoted by your correspondent A.W.H. affords, I think, a
  reasonable argument to prove that Herodotus did not commence his work
  until an advanced age; most probably between the ages of seventy and
  seventy-seven years. Moreover, there are various other reasons to justify
  the same conclusion; all which A.W.H. will find stated in Dr. Smith's
  <i>Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology</i>, vol. ii. I
  believe A.W.H. is correct in his supposition that the passage has not
  been noticed before.</p>

  your readers tell me whether there be not an older Welsh word for
  <i>water</i>? There are, I know, two sets of Welsh numerals, of which the
  later contains many Greek words, but the older are entirely different. Is
  not <i>cader</i> akin to <span lang="el" title="kathedra"

  <p><i>The Word "Alarm"</i> (Vol. ii., pp. 151. 183.).&mdash;I send you an

  interesting. In an account of the attempt made on the 29th of Oct. 1795,
  to assassinate Geo. III., the Earl of Onslow (as cited in Maunder's
  <i>Universal Biog.</i> p. 321.) uses the following expression:&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>The Conquest</i> (Vol. ii., p 440).&mdash;W.L. is informed that I
  have before me several old parchment documents or title-deeds, in which
  the words "post conquestum" are used merely to express (as part of their
  dates) the year after the accession of those kings respectively in whose
  reigns those documents were made.</p>

  <p><i>Land Holland</i> (Vol. ii., p. 267. 345.).&mdash;J.B.C. does not
  say in what part of England he finds this term used. Holland, in
  Lincolnshire, is by Ingulph called <i>Hoiland</i>, a name which has been
  thought to mean <i>hedgeland</i>, in allusion to the sea-walls or hedges
  by which it was preserved from inundation. Other etymologies have also
  been proposed. (See Gough's <i>Camden</i>, "Lincolnshire.") In Norfolk,
  however, the term <i>olland</i> is used, Forby tells us, for "arable land
  which has been laid down in grass more than two years, q.d.
  <i>old-land</i>." In a Norfolk paper of few months since, in an
  advertisement of a ploughing match, I observe a prize is offered "To the
  ploughman, with good character, who shall plough a certain quantity of
  <i>olland</i> within the least time, in the best manner."</p>

<h2>MISCELLANEOUS.</h2>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</h3>

  <p>The Camden Society have just issued to the members a highly important
  volume, Walter Mapes <i>De Nugis Curialium</i>. The best idea of the
  interesting character of this work may be formed from the manner in which
  it is described by its editor, Mr. Thomas Wright, who speaks of it as
  "the book in which this remarkable man seems to have amused himself with
  putting down his own sentiments on the passing events of the day, along
  with the popular gossip of the courtiers with whom he mixed;" and as
  being "one mass of contemporary anecdote, romance, and popular legend,
  interesting equally by its curiosity and by its novelty." There can be
  little doubt that the work will be welcomed, not only by the members of
  the Camden Society, but by all students of our early history and all
  lovers of our Folk Lore.</p>

  <p>Though we do not generally notice the publication of works of fiction,
  the handsome manner in which, in the third volume of his <i>Bertha, a
  Romance of the Dark Ages</i>, Mr. MacCabe has thought right to speak of
  the information which he obtained, during the progress of his work,
  through the medium of NOTES AND QUERIES, induces us to make an exception
  in favour of his highly interesting story. At the same time, that very
  acknowledgment almost forbids our speaking in such high terms as we
  otherwise should of the power with which Mr. MacCabe has worked up this
  striking narrative, which take its name from Bertha, the wife of the
  profligate Henry IV. of Germany; and of which the main incidents turn on
  Henry's deposition of the Pope, and his consequent excommunication by the
  inflexible Gregory the Seventh. But we the less regret this necessity of
  speaking thus moderately, since it must be obvious that when an
  accomplished scholar like the <!-- Page 31 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page31"></a>{31}</span> author of the <i>Catholic History of
  England</i>, to whom old chronicles are as household words, chooses to
  weave their most striking passages into a romance, his work will be of a
  very different stamp from that of the ordinary novelist, who has hunted
  over the same chronicles for the mere purpose of finding startling
  incidents. The one will present his readers, as Mr. MacCabe has done,
  with a picture uniform in style and consistent in colouring, while the
  other will at best only exhibit a few brilliant scenes, which, like the
  views in a magic lanthorn, will owe as much of their brilliancy to the
  darkness with which they are contrasted as to the skill of the
  artist.</p>

  <p>Messrs. Sotheby and Co. will sell, on Wednesday next and three
  following days, the valuable Collection of Coins and Medals of the Rev.
  Dr. Neligan, of Cork; and on the following Monday that gentleman's highly
  interesting Antiquities, Illuminated MSS., Ancient Glass, Bronzes,
  Etruscan and Roman Pottery, Silver Ring Money, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>To those who have never studied what Voltaire maliciously designated
  "the science of fools with long memories," but yet occasionally wish to
  know the families which have borne certain mottoes, the new edition of
  <i>The Book of Mottoes</i> will be a very acceptable source of
  information.</p>

<h3>NOTICES TO CORRESPONDENTS.</h3>

  <p><i>To meet the wishes of many friends, and to avoid the inconvenience
  arising from the diversity of prices in our Monthly Parts, we propose in
  future to publish a fifth, or Supplementary Number, every Month in which
  these are only four Saturdays. By this arrangement our Monthly Parts will
  be of the uniform price of One shilling and Three pence, with the
  exception of those for January and July, which will include the Index of
  the preceding half-year at the price of One shilling and Ninepence each.
  Thus the yearly subscription to </i>NOTES AND QUERIES<i>, either in
  unstamped Weekly Numbers or Monthly Parts, will be </i>SIXTEEN
  SHILLINGS<i>. The subscription for the Stamped Edition, with which
  Gentlemen may be supplied regularly by giving their Orders direct to the
  Publisher, </i>MR. GEORGE BELL, 186. Fleet Street<i> (accompanied by a
  Post Office Order), is One pound and Fourpence for a twelve-month, or Ten
  shillings and Two pence for six months</i>.</p>

  <p>WILLIAM C. PENNY <i>is referred for an account of the National Anthem
  to Clarke's</i> "History of God Save the King."</p>

  delivery with our next Number</i>.</p>

  <p>NOTES AND QUERIES <i>may be procured, by order, of all Booksellers and
  Newsvenders. It is published at noon on Friday, so that our country
  Subscribers ought not to experience any difficulty in procuring it
  regularly. Many of the country Booksellers, &amp;c., are, probably, not
  yet aware of this arrangement, which will enable them to receive
  </i>NOTES AND QUERIES<i> in their Saturday parcels</i>.</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
